## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv add flask flask-cors pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn psycopg2-binary sqlalchemy
   ```

2. Set up PostgreSQL database and configure DATABASE_URL environment variable

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Access the web application at `http://localhost:5000` and navigate through:

1. **New Assessment**: Complete tumor measurement survey for risk evaluation
2. **My History**: View personal assessment history with trend analysis
3. **Analytics**: Platform-wide statistics and risk distribution data

## Assessment Process

1. **Input Measurements**: Provide 30 tumor characteristics across three categories:
   - Mean measurements (radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc.)
   - Standard error measurements
   - Worst (largest) measurements

2. **AI Analysis**: The system processes measurements through trained logistic regression model

3. **Risk Evaluation**: Receive probability-based risk assessment with:
   - Interactive gauge chart visualization
   - Risk level classification (Very Low, Low, Moderate, High)
   - Medical recommendations
   - Detailed result explanation

## Input Requirements

The survey requires 30 tumor characteristics organized in three categories:

### Mean Values (10 features)
- Radius (6-30), Texture (9-40), Perimeter (40-190), Area (140-2500)
- Smoothness (0.05-0.16), Compactness (0.02-0.35), Concavity (0-0.43)
- Concave Points (0-0.2), Symmetry (0.1-0.3), Fractal Dimension (0.05-0.1)

### Standard Error Values (10 features)
- Standard errors for each of the above measurements

### Worst Values (10 features)
- Worst-case measurements for each characteristic

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, Python, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Plotly.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Plotly, interactive charts

## Model Information

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression (implemented from scratch)
- **Training Data**: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (569 samples)
- **Features**: 30 tumor characteristics
- **Performance**: High accuracy on benign/malignant classification
- **Validation**: Comprehensive model evaluation with medical metrics

## Data Security

- All assessment data is securely stored in PostgreSQL database
- User sessions are managed with secure session handling
- Medical data is processed with appropriate privacy considerations

## Medical Disclaimer

This platform is designed for educational and research purposes. All assessments should be confirmed by qualified medical professionals. The AI predictions are not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis or treatment.

## Data Source

The system is trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset containing features computed from digitized images of breast mass fine needle aspirates (569 samples, 30 features).
